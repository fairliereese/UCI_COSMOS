# **How to find Research Articles**

There are two ways you could do this, through [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) or using a [research database](https://guides.lib.uci.edu/databases). For both, you must make sure you are logged on to the UCI VPN ***first***.

# Using a Research Database
You have access to research databases through the UCI website and VPN connection. On the [UCI Libraries webpage](https://www.lib.uci.edu), click on "[Databases To Get You Started](https://guides.lib.uci.edu/databases)" on the right hand side. Alternatively you can type "uci libraries database" in Google and click on the first link.

I like to use the first database listed, "Academic Search Complete" and here it what it looks like:

## EBSCOhost search example: DUX4

Here is an example of a search through EBSCOhost research database. These are the search conditions I chose:

Once you find an article you want to read, click on the title and then select either "PDF Full Text" or "HTML Full Text" on the left hand side. If you see neither, then you do not have access to that research article.

# Using Google Scholar
You can either start typing key words into the search bar or navigate to the "Advanced search" option. To do this, click on the three line icon on the top left hand side and a side bar should appear. Click on "Advanced search" and enter your search conditions into the new dialog box.

Here is an example of an advanced search through Google Scholar. These are the search conditions I chose:

These are the search results I get:

### Note:

Notice how google takes the search conditions: with **all** of the words, with the **exact phrase**, with **at least one** of the words, etc, and converts it to the search phrase: DUX4 myogenesis OR deregulation "gene expression".

This means you can use search syntax straight into the google search bar. 

Some of these include:
- **quotes** to search for exact phrases
- **hyphen** to exclude words
- **AND** to search for all search terms (must be in all caps)
- **OR** to search for one term or another (must be in all caps)
